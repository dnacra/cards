-> update main activity to support landscape better; move tabs to the left-hand side when in landscape?

-> missing search functionality

-> update build to make sure we can publish to existing playstore swccg app

-> when handling formats / sets, make sure we are correctly getting defensive shields if virtual set 0 is legal.

-> configure proguard?  Do we need the consumer proguard file
    -> use R8 instead?

-> Make a real theme / pick material colors / pick a font / etc.
    -> Once we have the basic app working again, use these links to help get the design looking nice and sweet.
