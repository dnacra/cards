APP-WORK
======================================
update default JSON to latest!
    swccg
    meccg
    trek

Try to re-submit Trek 2.0?



// LATER
in the card search results list view, zoom in on the card IMAGE more, like that other ios did

SETTINGS / localization?
    * MECCG
        SETTINGS? english vs spanish cards?  do we have spanish strings in the json?

CARD HOLO / 3D EFFECT

add Settings!
 * only download set data over wifi?

Flesh and Blood version of the app?






LATER
======================================
-> Add another CR adding a new "rules.json" file to the json repo.
    -> File is a dictionary:
        "ruleId": List<String>
    -> card rulings can refer to a shared rule.  shared rulings are inserted into the cards rulings list.
    -> Refer to shared ruling by:
        "$ruleId"
        IE, if the rule starts with a $, take the rest of the string and use it as a key into the shared rules dictionary.
        If the ruleId doesn't exist, just use the string as normal, ie a rule with "$thisIsMyMispellledRuleId" will be in the list.

TAB Improvements
-> make tab size a little taller.
-> Can we somehow move the X  (close tab) functionality to a different place?  Would make it easier to navigate around without accidentally closing a tab.

GENERAL:
-> Add checklist/collection feature.  Just a button on the large card screen, that lets you add how many you have in your collection.  Allow users to somehow specify what cards they own (and how many?).

-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works?

-> Implement improved HTTP caching?  https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/463
    -> Might not be worth it, rare use case that will make the experience worse 99.9% of the time.
        Recommend just clearing the app cache in these situations.
        OR, push for new image urls when updating an image with an eratta/change.

-> Add a gear icon, on the top right opposite "Search Text" which will open settings.  Inside the settings, allow the user to download the cards and store them locally.  Should be able to download by sets?  or all at once?  Not sure.  Maybe, to keep it simple, just walk through all cards in the json and download them locally, along with the "timestamp".  So then in the future you can try to re-download everything and it will check all the images, and update the locally saved image if the remote was updated?
