APP-WORK
======================================
- post on facebook for each app
- at some point, add display of legacy cards?
- parallelize card repo downloads, when there are 2+ files.  (light/dark json, physical/virtual json, etc).





LATER
======================================
- SWCCG rule links, somehow?

- support searching abbr when searching title?  Not sure I like this feature.

GENERAL:
-> Add checklist/collection feature.  Just a button on the large card screen, that lets you add how many you have in your collection.  Allow users to somehow specify what cards they own (and how many?).

-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works?

-> Implement improved HTTP caching?  https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/463
    -> Might not be worth it, rare use case that will make the experience worse 99.9% of the time.
        Recommend just clearing the app cache in these situations.
        OR, push for new image urls when updating an image with an eratta/change.

-> Add a gear icon, on the top right opposite "Search Text" which will open settings.  Inside the settings, allow the user to download the cards and store them locally.  Should be able to download by sets?  or all at once?  Not sure.  Maybe, to keep it simple, just walk through all cards in the json and download them locally, along with the "timestamp".  So then in the future you can try to re-download everything and it will check all the images, and update the locally saved image if the remote was updated?
