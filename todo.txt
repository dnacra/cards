APP-WORK
======================================
- SWCCG rule links, somehow?

- NEED to get icons for the ROTATE / FLIP and RULINGS buttons.
    Will save space on the bottom for more options moving forward and let me add the rulings button.

SHARE icon as well, move sharing so its not a long press

-> Finish reworking swipe screen with new buttons.
-> Make sure swipe screen handles widescreen?  Just delete widescreen layout?
-> test swipe screen buttons in dark mode
-> move share action to share button, remove long press
-> review strings, remove unused

-> check all other apps for swipe

-> remove loading_large image, use tinted drawable instead




LATER
======================================
- support searching abbr when searching title?  Not sure I like this feature.

GENERAL:
-> Add checklist/collection feature.  Just a button on the large card screen, that lets you add how many you have in your collection.  Allow users to somehow specify what cards they own (and how many?).

-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works?

-> Implement improved HTTP caching?  https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/463
    -> Might not be worth it, rare use case that will make the experience worse 99.9% of the time.
        Recommend just clearing the app cache in these situations.
        OR, push for new image urls when updating an image with an eratta/change.

-> Add a gear icon, on the top right opposite "Search Text" which will open settings.  Inside the settings, allow the user to download the cards and store them locally.  Should be able to download by sets?  or all at once?  Not sure.  Maybe, to keep it simple, just walk through all cards in the json and download them locally, along with the "timestamp".  So then in the future you can try to re-download everything and it will check all the images, and update the locally saved image if the remote was updated?
