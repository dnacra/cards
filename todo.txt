APP-WORK
======================================
-> Continue working on release process so we can run one command to publish all versions of the app to open testing track on the playstore.

./gradlew bundleRelease
    -> will build all bundles


MECCG Filters:
    -> Alignment
    -> Type ---> Primary
    -> Keys ---> Race, will have to do some special handling for the keys to use.
    -> Set

    -> Terms ---> Skill, will also have to do some special handling

Potential MECCG App Names:
    Book of Mazarbul
+   Miruvor
    Red Book of Westmarch
    Ringlore
    Vilya
    Narya
    Nenya
++  Named "Ringlore" but with Vilya as the icon?




LATER
======================================
-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works.
