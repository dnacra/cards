APP-WORK
======================================
-> Finish InfoFragment layout / rules format.

-> cardbacks for other games as well
    -> MECCG, use region backs for region cards, etc

-> update MECCG and TREK
-> Verify all long-press handling is removed.
-> review strings, remove unused
-> test everything in dark mode
-> complete lint check!

Release Notes
- Updated the Title text search to also search Abbreviations.
- Added all Legacy cards.  The default format will not show Legacy cards, make sure you select a different format to see them.
- Updated icons on the main card screen.
- Added a new rulings screen, which will be accessible for cards that have rulings available.
- Updated the loading image.




LATER
======================================
TAB Improvements
-> make tab size a little bigger.
-> Can we somehow move the X  (close tab) functionality to a different place?  Would make it easier to navigate arond iwthout accidentally closing a tab.

GENERAL:
-> Add checklist/collection feature.  Just a button on the large card screen, that lets you add how many you have in your collection.  Allow users to somehow specify what cards they own (and how many?).

-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works?

-> Implement improved HTTP caching?  https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/463
    -> Might not be worth it, rare use case that will make the experience worse 99.9% of the time.
        Recommend just clearing the app cache in these situations.
        OR, push for new image urls when updating an image with an eratta/change.

-> Add a gear icon, on the top right opposite "Search Text" which will open settings.  Inside the settings, allow the user to download the cards and store them locally.  Should be able to download by sets?  or all at once?  Not sure.  Maybe, to keep it simple, just walk through all cards in the json and download them locally, along with the "timestamp".  So then in the future you can try to re-download everything and it will check all the images, and update the locally saved image if the remote was updated?
