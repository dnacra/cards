APP-WORK
======================================




LATER
======================================
-> Once PADD 1.0 & 2.0 is finished, create a new repo with the sets.jsons I created.

-> Enable fastscroll on the SearchResultsFragment once the bug in RecyclerView has been fixed.
-> Populate auto-suggestions for custom filters similar to how scomp link works.

-> Implement improved HTTP caching?  https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues/463
    -> Might not be worth it, rare use case that will make the experience worse 99.9% of the time.  Recommend just clearing the app cache in these situations.
    -> Add force download button, to clear image cache for a particular image?
