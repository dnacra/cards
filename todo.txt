-> Add another CR adding a new "rules.json" file to the json repo.
    -> File is a dictionary:
        "ruleId": List<String>
    -> card rulings can refer to a shared rule.  shared rulings are inserted into the cards rulings list.
    -> Refer to shared ruling by:
        "$ruleId"
        IE, if the rule starts with a $, take the rest of the string and use it as a key into the shared rules dictionary.
        If the ruleId doesn't exist, just use the string as normal, ie a rule with "$thisIsMyMispellledRuleId" will be in the list.
